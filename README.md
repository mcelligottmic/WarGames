1. Game name.

 	War Games

2. Game concept and basic rules.
War Games is a turn-based game played on a board between two players. The goal is to capture the enemy’s capital without having your capital captured. Players have different units that they can move around in order to meet this goal.
Step-up:
•	Each player starts out with one capital city, six infantry, and two tanks
•	Players place all their pieces on their side of the map
Turn:
•	Players can move each unit once (excluding the capital)
•	If a unit collides with another unit the two units engage each other.
Scoring:
•	The game ends when one player moves a unit into the same tile as the opponent’s capital. Upon moving the piece the capital is destroyed and the player with their capital remaining is the winner.
•	Conflict between two units is calculated by the attacking unit dealing damage to the defending unit. If the defending unit is not destroyed it returns fire. Each unit attacks only once.

3. Reference for the game.
	Stratego / Game of the Generals

4. Camera
	Each player will be able to zoom in and out of the battle field (game board).

5. Modeling
	There will be different units in the game with very different shapes. Also the map itself will have different terrain tiles. These tiles will be made up of different textures (ie. Sand, water, grass).

6. Lighting and Shading
	Units, buildings, and certain terrain features will have shadows. The light source will be an overhead that will give the effect of the sun shining on the game board. Also each player can only see a certain distance from their units and the rest of the game board will appear shaded giving the impression of the fog of war.

7. Animation
 	Upon a player selecting an unit that unit will light up. The player than can select a terrain tile to move that unit to.

8. Interactivity
	Players will interact with the game board using the mouse to select units and move them.
